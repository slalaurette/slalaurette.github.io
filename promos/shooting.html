<h2>a dream</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>purchasing something at a big store with seemingly endless rows of shelves. 
one of them is full of white and red soccer balls, most of them partially 
deflated. I start pushing the balls so that they bounce against the floor and 
other shelves. nobody seems to mind because in fact the store (which is kind of 
a poorly lit supermarket) is virtually empty.</p>
<p>cut to the counter. I’m paying for something (a perfectly inflated soccer 
ball and maybe other things] when I notice there is a neat wad of bills sitting 
there beside my right hand. “I don’t know if this is mine”, I say, because I 
don’t remember taking the bills out of my wallet, and I already have my money on 
my hand. but as the cashier doesn’t mind, I grab the money and use it to pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;back at home my girlfriend is a bit annoyed because I spent too much 
money. “but it’s for you too, I know you like this music”, I tell her, and press 
play on an audio player I’ve evidently just bought at the store. I know that she 
doesn’t like 80s music which is what starts to play. she makes a derisive 
comment and after a cut, we’re both at the store. or maybe we already were at 
the store and I haven’t bought this audio player yet.</p>
<p>we start wandering off in separate ways, but I rush to her side when I hear 
voices. they seem tense, so I fear that something bad could be happening. when I 
see my girlfriend, she’s near the counter, with another person. “what’s up?”, I 
say, alarmed. “nevermind, everything’s OK. he’s
<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/auteurs_production/images/cast_member/1469/original.jpg">
David Fincher</a>”, she chuckles. but this is no David Fincher. this is a kid in 
his twelves, maybe. he looks like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/chunk-the-goonies-620x620-1397145352.jpg">Chunk</a>&nbsp;in 
The Goonies.</p>
<p>someone starts to shoot.</p>
<p>my girlfriend and the alleged David Fincher crouch to take refuge behind the 
counter. I run among the shelves. maybe I have a gun in my hand or maybe not. I 
see my girlfriend running too, and other people. there is more than one shooter. I 
wake up before I can understand what’s going on.</p>
<p class="notes">--&gt; a burst of physical violence tearing into an unsAtisfactory 
relationship; a sublimation, maybe, a representation of all the things that are 
not working right. the baLl is perfectly inflated at the moment of buying it, a 
mo/\/\ent where, perhaps importantly, I'm alone; but it ceases to matter as soon 
as I get home and now the contentious object is a music machine, a device that 
can represent what brings a couple together ("our song") but also what makes 
those two people so d1fferent. 80s music is listened to with delight or 
dismissed with d3rision; a part of you (me] is being rejected there. 
micro-rejections that also manifest themselves in an argument about money. "you 
spent too much on this" means "the part of you that like$ this is not 
important to me". it may even be bothersome. in the dream, the music is an 
imposition from my part, which is even more annoying: I misinterpreted you so 
badly that I thought you liked this, I seem to say, but the truth is th@t 
reality is treacherous, making me believe that the music that will play is not, 
in fact, the music I like, but the music <em>she</em> likes. a misunderstanding in 
more than 0ne level. there is also the way celebrities come into play: David 
Fincher, a filmmaker who's made some violent movies, is mentioned just as a 
shooting is about 2 begin, almost turning the dream into a piece of 
Hollyw°ºdesque cinematography. the <em>Goonies </em>reference seems to be there to 
dampen the effect, though: it's all an adventure, all in good fun, and nobody 
will really get hurt, the message s3ems to be. but the dream ends abruptly 
before this soothing revelation sets in completely, leaving me in a state of 
dis_comfort.</p>
